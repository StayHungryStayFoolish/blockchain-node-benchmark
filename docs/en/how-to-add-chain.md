# How to Add a Blockchain or RPC Method

[中文](../zh/how-to-add-chain.md) | [English](how-to-add-chain.md)

This is the operational guide for extending the current framework. Chain template fields are documented through the examples in `config/chains/*.json` and the steps below. For fake-node details, see the [fake-node README](../../tools/fake-node/README.md).

## Core Principle

When adding a chain, separate two concerns:

- **Request-building schema can be reused**: if the new chain belongs to an existing family, it can reuse the adapter, proxy extractor, target generator, and fake-node handler.
- **Response fixtures cannot be reused by default**: even if two methods both accept `address` or `tx_hash`, each `chain + method` must have its own real recorded response.

fake-node matches responses at this granularity:

```text
chain + rpc method + family handler + fixture
```

So after adding a chain or method, record real request/response fixtures. Do not reuse an older fixture only because the parameter name looks similar.

## How to Choose One of the 6 Families

Family is not based on brand, token, or ecosystem. It is based on the actual RPC request and parsing shape.

| Family | When to use it | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `jsonrpc` | Standard JSON-RPC POST with `method` in the request body | Ethereum, Solana, Sui, Tron, Avalanche C |
| `bitcoin_jsonrpc` | Bitcoin Core / UTXO-style JSON-RPC, possibly with Basic Auth or REST workarounds | Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, BCH |
| `rest` | HTTP path/body is the primary interface; logical methods map through `_meta.rest_paths` | Aptos, Algorand, Cardano, Tezos, TON |
| `substrate` | Polkadot SDK / Substrate RPC, such as `chain_*`, `state_*`, `system_*` | Polkadot, Kusama, Acala |
| `tendermint` | Cosmos SDK / Tendermint / CometBFT REST-RPC | Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Celestia |
| `hedera_dual` | Hedera Mirror REST plus Hashio JSON-RPC Relay | Hedera |

If the request envelope, parameter structure, endpoint routing, authentication/header behavior, response envelope, and block-height parsing fit one of these families, this is usually a configuration-only extension.

If the existing families cannot express those behaviors, extend or add an adapter and fake-node handler.

## Add a Chain in an Existing Family

### 1. Create the Chain Template

Add:

```text
config/chains/<chain>.json
```

Start by copying a similar chain in the same family:

- New EVM chain: copy `config/chains/ethereum.json`, `arbitrum.json`, or `base.json`
- New Cosmos chain: copy `config/chains/cosmos-hub.json`
- New Substrate chain: copy `config/chains/polkadot.json`
- New REST chain: copy `config/chains/aptos.json` or `algorand.json`

### 2. Configure the Base Fields

Confirm these fields:

```json
{
  "chain_type": "<chain>",
  "rpc_url": "LOCAL_RPC_URL",
  "params": {},
  "rpc_methods": {},
  "param_formats": {},
  "system_addresses": [],
  "_meta": {
    "adapter_family": "<family>"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `chain_type` should match the file name.
- `rpc_url` should usually remain `LOCAL_RPC_URL` in the production framework.
- `_meta.adapter_family` must be one of the existing 6 families.

### 3. Configure RPC Methods

`single` is the default method when the user chooses single mode.

`mixed` is a method list used for compatibility and readability.

`mixed_weighted` is the current preferred source for mixed-mode traffic generation.

Example:

```json
{
  "rpc_methods": {
    "single": "eth_getBalance",
    "mixed": "eth_getBalance,eth_blockNumber,eth_getBlockByNumber,eth_call",
    "mixed_weighted": [
      {"method": "eth_getBalance", "weight": 40},
      {"method": "eth_blockNumber", "weight": 30},
      {"method": "eth_getBlockByNumber", "weight": 20},
      {"method": "eth_call", "weight": 10}
    ]
  }
}
```

Use weights that sum to 100 when possible because they are easier to audit. The framework generates vegeta targets proportionally.

### Mixed Workload Realism

The default templates are designed to be stable for framework regression tests.
They are not a universal production workload model. If you want mixed mode to
simulate real end-user traffic, tune `mixed_weighted` for your chain and
application.

Prefer a mix of method shapes:

| Traffic type | Examples | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Chain status / tip | `eth_blockNumber`, `getBlockHeight`, `system_chain` | Low-cost baseline traffic and health-like reads. |
| Account / balance / object reads | `eth_getBalance`, `getAccountInfo`, REST account paths | Common wallet, explorer, and dApp reads. |
| Transaction / receipt reads | `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, `getrawtransaction`, transaction-by-hash paths | Common user support, wallet, and explorer lookups. |
| Block reads | `eth_getBlockByNumber`, `getblock`, block-by-height paths | Higher response volume and storage access. |
| Contract / view calls | `eth_call`, `POST /v1/view`, `runGetMethod` | Closer to dApp production behavior than status-only traffic. |
| Logs / events / indexer queries | `eth_getLogs`, account transaction paths, validator/pool queries | Often more expensive and closer to analytics/explorer traffic. |

Avoid a mixed workload made mostly of `no_params` methods unless you are only
testing the framework plumbing. A realistic production profile should include
some address, transaction, block, and contract/view methods when the chain
supports them.

When changing `mixed_weighted`:

1. Add or select the method in `rpc_methods.mixed_weighted`.
2. Add the matching `param_formats.<method>`.
3. Add real sample values in `params` using `${TARGET_*:-measured-default}`.
4. For REST/path methods, add `_meta.rest_paths.<method>`.
5. If the method needs explicit positional params, object fields, query values,
   or body fields, add `param_spec.<method>`.
6. Validate request construction with `python3 tools/chain_adapters/cli.py validate-template --chain <chain>`.
7. Add the fake-node family YAML mapping under `tools/fake-node/configs/`.
8. Record the method's own fixture and run coverage/runtime probes.

Do not add a method only because it is listed in official docs. Add it when the
framework can build a valid request, record a real response, replay it through
fake-node, and include it in the proxy/HTML attribution path.

### 4. Configure Parameter Formats

Every method used by `single` or `mixed_weighted` must be buildable by the
selected adapter. For simple JSON-RPC methods, use a `param_formats` entry.

Example:

```json
{
  "param_formats": {
    "eth_getBalance": "address_latest",
    "eth_blockNumber": "no_params",
    "eth_getBlockByNumber": "block_number",
    "eth_call": "eth_call_object_latest"
  }
}
```

For simple methods, prefer `param_formats` because it keeps templates compact.
For methods that need explicit positional params, object fields, REST path
bindings, query parameters, or body templates, use optional `param_spec`:

```json
{
  "param_spec": {
    "eth_getBalance": {
      "transport": "jsonrpc_list",
      "params": [
        {"source": "address"},
        {"literal": "latest"}
      ]
    },
    "GET_ACCOUNT_TXS": {
      "transport": "rest_query",
      "bindings": {
        "address": {"source": "address"}
      },
      "query": {
        "limit": {"literal": 10}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Supported transports are `jsonrpc_list`, `jsonrpc_dict`, `rest_path`,
`rest_query`, and `rest_body`. After editing the template, run:

```bash
python3 tools/chain_adapters/cli.py validate-template --chain <chain>
```

If the method is still not expressible by `param_formats`, `_meta.rest_paths`,
or `param_spec`, extend `tools/chain_adapters/<family>.py`.

#### Complete Example: Three-Argument JSON-RPC Method

`eth_getStorageAt(address, storageSlot, blockTag)` needs three ordered
arguments. Add the method to the workload, provide a real sample slot, define
`param_spec`, then make sure proxy extraction and fake-node fixtures use the
same method name.

Chain template:

```json
{
  "params": {
    "target_address": "${TARGET_ADDRESS:-0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000}",
    "target_storage_slot": "${TARGET_STORAGE_SLOT:-0x0}"
  },
  "rpc_methods": {
    "single": "eth_getBalance",
    "mixed_weighted": [
      {"method": "eth_getBalance", "weight": 40},
      {"method": "eth_blockNumber", "weight": 30},
      {"method": "eth_getStorageAt", "weight": 30}
    ]
  },
  "param_spec": {
    "eth_getStorageAt": {
      "transport": "jsonrpc_list",
      "params": [
        {"source": "address"},
        {"source": "target_storage_slot"},
        {"literal": "latest"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "proxy_extraction": {
    "protocol": "jsonrpc",
    "method_path": "method",
    "fallback_method": "unknown"
  }
}
```

fake-node family YAML:

```yaml
methods:
  eth_getStorageAt:
    fixture: eth_getStorageAt.json
    tier: expensive
```

Validation:

```bash
python3 tools/chain_adapters/cli.py validate-template --chain <chain>
tools/fake-node/record_rpc_fixtures.sh <chain>
python3 tools/fake-node/check_fixture_coverage.py
```

After these pass, `eth_getStorageAt` participates in mixed weighted target
generation and appears in the per-method report charts by the same method name.

### 5. Configure Real Sample Parameters

Put real queryable sample values in `params`. Common examples:

```json
{
  "params": {
    "target_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "target_tx_hash": "0x...",
    "target_height": 123456,
    "target_block_hash": "0x..."
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `tx_hash` must exist on that chain and be queryable from the endpoint.
- `address` should preferably exist and have balance or activity.
- REST chains often require chain-specific samples such as `asset_id`, `token_id`, `validator_address`, or `denom`.

If the sample is not real, fixture recording may produce 400/404/empty responses, and fake-node will not simulate production behavior.

### 6. Configure REST Paths or Sidecar Paths

REST family, or families using sidecar paths, need `_meta.rest_paths`.

Example:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "adapter_family": "rest",
    "rest_paths": {
      "GET /v1/accounts/{addr}/transactions": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/v1/accounts/{address}/transactions"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The logical method name may be identical to the HTTP path, or it may be a more readable key. It must still map consistently through the adapter and fake-node fixture.

### 7. Configure Sync Health

`_meta.sync_health` tells the block height monitor how to judge node health.

Supported modes:

- `absolute_gap`: local and target/mainnet endpoints return numeric heights; compare `target - local`.
- `conditional_gap`: for example EVM `eth_syncing`, where syncing returns an object and not syncing returns `false`.
- `reported_lag`: the local node reports its own lag, such as Solana `getHealth`.
- `freshness_only`: no reliable mainnet height is available; use probe success or local progress freshness.
- `health_only`: only a boolean or coarse health result is available.

Example:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "sync_health": {
      "mode": "conditional_gap",
      "local_probe": "adapter.sync_status_request(local_rpc_url)",
      "comparison": "local_reported_gap",
      "threshold_env": "BLOCK_HEIGHT_DIFF_THRESHOLD",
      "time_threshold_env": "BLOCK_HEIGHT_TIME_THRESHOLD",
      "threshold_unit": "block",
      "notes": "eth_syncing returns false when node is not syncing; otherwise highestBlock-currentBlock is used."
    }
  }
}
```

Prefer the existing thresholds:

- `BLOCK_HEIGHT_DIFF_THRESHOLD`
- `BLOCK_HEIGHT_TIME_THRESHOLD`

Add a new config variable only when the chain exposes a genuinely different unit that cannot be mapped to the existing diff/time model.

## Record Fixtures

Run:

```bash
tools/fake-node/record_rpc_fixtures.sh <chain>
```

Outputs:

```text
tools/fake-node/fixtures/<chain>/*.json
docs/audit/rpc-fixtures/<chain>/<method>/{request.json,response.json,meta.json}  # local audit evidence, not normally committed
```

If a method requires a real `tx_hash`, `address`, `height`, or `asset_id`, add it to `params` before recording. Do not record placeholders.

## Verify

### Fixture Coverage

```bash
python3 tools/fake-node/check_fixture_coverage.py --json
```

Every configured `single` and `mixed_weighted` method must be covered by a committed fake-node fixture.

For local authenticity checks after recording request/response evidence, run:

```bash
python3 tools/fake-node/validate_fixture_authenticity.py --json
python3 tools/fake-node/check_fixture_coverage.py --json --strict
```

### Runtime Probe

```bash
python3 tools/fake-node/runtime_probe.py
python3 tools/fake-node/runtime_probe_block_height.py
```

To check whether a tool supports single-chain filtering:

```bash
python3 tools/fake-node/runtime_probe.py --help
python3 tools/fake-node/runtime_probe_block_height.py --help
```

### Sync Health Registry

```bash
python3 tools/audit_sync_health_registry.py --write --json
```

The new chain must appear in the registry audit with no errors.

## Local End-to-End Smoke Test

Run this in Docker/Linux. The framework does not target macOS compatibility.

Prepare a small account file:

```bash
mkdir -p //blockchain-node-benchmark-result/current/tmp
cat > //blockchain-node-benchmark-result/current/tmp/active_accounts.txt <<EOF
<address-1>
<address-2>
<address-3>
EOF
```

Run fake-node + proxy + mixed quick smoke:

```bash
export BLOCKCHAIN_NODE=<chain>
export RPC_MODE=mixed
export QUICK_INITIAL_QPS=1
export QUICK_MAX_QPS=1
export QUICK_QPS_STEP=1
export QUICK_DURATION=3
export QPS_WARMUP_DURATION=0
export QPS_COOLDOWN=0
export BLOCK_HEIGHT_MONITOR_RATE=1

./blockchain_node_benchmark.sh \
  --quick \
  --mixed \
  --fake-node \
  --initial-qps 1 \
  --max-qps 1 \
  --step-qps 1 \
  --duration 3
```

Check:

```bash
ls -lh //blockchain-node-benchmark-result/archives/
```

Look for:

- vegeta requests succeeded.
- `logs/proxy_method.csv` contains workload methods, not only health probes.
- `logs/block_height_monitor_*.csv` contains `sync_mode` / `sync_status`.
- `reports/performance_report_en_*.html` or `reports/performance_report_zh_*.html` was generated.
- per-method charts were generated.

## Add an RPC Method

If you are only adding a method to an existing chain:

1. Add `param_formats.<method>` to `config/chains/<chain>.json`, or add `param_spec.<method>` if the request shape is too specific for a built-in format.
2. If the method participates in mixed mode, add it to `rpc_methods.mixed` and `mixed_weighted`.
3. If it is a REST method, add `_meta.rest_paths.<method>`.
4. Validate request construction with `python3 tools/chain_adapters/cli.py validate-template --chain <chain>`.
5. Add the method-to-fixture mapping in the fake-node family YAML.
6. Prepare real sample parameters.
7. Record fixtures again.
8. Run authenticity, coverage, and runtime probes.

JSON-RPC example:

```json
{
  "param_formats": {
    "eth_getTransactionReceipt": "transaction_hash"
  },
  "rpc_methods": {
    "mixed_weighted": [
      {"method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt", "weight": 10}
    ]
  },
  "params": {
    "target_tx_hash": "0x..."
  }
}
```

fake-node YAML example:

```yaml
methods:
  eth_getTransactionReceipt:
    fixture: eth_getTransactionReceipt.json
    tier: expensive
```

## When Code Changes Are Required

Adding a chain in an existing family ideally requires no Python or Go changes.

Code changes are required when:

- The new request envelope is not expressible as existing JSON-RPC or REST/sidecar behavior.
- Authentication or header rules cannot be expressed by current configuration.
- Parameters need chain-specific encoding not supported by existing `param_formats` or `param_spec`.
- Block height or health status responses cannot be parsed by existing sync health logic.
- The current fake-node family handler cannot route or replay the request.
- A chain routes methods to multiple endpoints in a way that the existing family cannot express.

If you add a new family, update all of these:

- `tools/chain_adapters/<family>.py`
- `tools/fake-node/handlers/<family>.go`
- `tools/fake-node/configs/<family>.yaml`
- chain template `_meta.adapter_family`
- proxy extraction DSL
- fixture recording and coverage tests
- docs and audit records

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Reusing a Response Because the Parameter Name Matches

Do not do this. `address` or `tx_hash` being the same does not mean the response structure is the same. Record the fixture for that exact `chain + method`.

### Mistake 2: `mixed_weighted` Has a Method the Adapter Cannot Build

The target generator cannot build the request. Every method must be covered by
`param_formats`, `_meta.rest_paths`, or `param_spec`, depending on its family
and request shape.

### Mistake 3: A REST Method Has No `_meta.rest_paths`

The REST adapter will not know the real HTTP path/body, which can cause request generation failures or 404s.

### Mistake 4: Treating 403/429/404 Fixtures as Success

Do not accept those fixtures. Use another public endpoint or fix the sample params and record again.

### Mistake 5: Missing Sync Health

The block height monitor cannot judge node health, and bottleneck detection/reporting will lose the health signal.

### Mistake 6: Running Coverage Without Authenticity

Coverage only says files exist. Authenticity says they are not placeholders or error responses. Run both.
